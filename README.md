A complete homepage configuration for anyone to use as an example to create their own homepage.

I have included my [docker-compose.yaml](/docker/docker-compose.yaml) deployment that I used on my Dockge to deploy my Homepage instance and also an [example.env](/docker/example.env) file with all my environment variables that are passed to the container.
